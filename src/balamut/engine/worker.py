"""One worker thread per daemon: take mutants until the queue is empty and decide each verdict exactly.

A candidate kill is accepted only for killers that pass on the immediately restored original (the paired run). A
warm verdict whose run never entered the mutated code object is deferred to a confirmation in a fresh fork. A hang
is a kill only when it is causal. Any daemon failure requeues the mutant and ends this worker; a failure to prove
exactness ends the lane.
