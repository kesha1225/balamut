"""The capability layer of the operator API: protocols, contexts and the enumeration fold.

A *fact* is any frozen value that speaks the operator protocols — there is no base class, no
registry and no closed set of kinds. The engine's folds dispatch on protocols structurally
(``Sites`` for the shared AST walk, ``Enumerates`` for whole-file phases); the report label of a
mutant is the kind's name, stamped by the fold; behavior flags are marker attributes (``Fuzzable``,
``SelfCovered``, ``LaneIsolated``). A new kind, a new family and a new behavior are each an
addition, never an edit to the core.
